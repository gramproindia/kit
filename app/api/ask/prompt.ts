 * measured with, so this demo's quality means the same thing the published
 * numbers mean.
 *
 * This repository already vendors `component-lib/2.0.0` the same way. Do not
 * edit it here: change it in the library, re-measure, and copy it across. A
 * prompt that drifts from the one the benchmark used makes both meaningless.
 *
 * Converted to an ES module; nothing else is changed.

/*
 * What the model sees. One builder, every model, no exceptions.
 *
 * If adapters were allowed to write their own prompts, a benchmark would be
 * comparing prompts and reporting it as a comparison of models. So this is the
 * only place a prompt is constructed, it is versioned, and the version is
 * recorded in every result file. Changing anything here means a new version
 * and results that are not comparable with the old ones.
 *
 * Two decisions worth stating, because they are what the prompt is *for*:
 *
 *   The model is told not to do arithmetic. "1 lakh" should be passed through
 *   as written. The coercion layer converts it deterministically, and a model
 *   that multiplies is a model that will eventually multiply wrong, silently.
 *   The same goes for percentages, currency and relative dates.
 *
 *   The model is given three ways to answer. A producer that can only emit a
 *   command has to guess when a request is ambiguous, and a confident wrong
 *   filter is the failure this whole architecture exists to prevent. Asking is
 *   a correct answer, and the scorer treats it as one.
 *
 * No dataset rows appear here. The runtime contract carries counts and bounded
 * summaries only, and `assertNoRows` in the runner proves it per case.

   * buys nothing. And a 1B model in a browser must read every one of those

   * phone, which is the difference between a feature and a demo.
