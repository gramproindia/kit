/*
 * The grid utterance corpus, checked against the real validator.
 *
 * Without a model there is no accuracy to measure, and that is fine — this is
 * not measuring a model. It is measuring the *contract*: whether every reading
 * a person would reasonably expect can be expressed as a command this grid
 * accepts, and whether everything that should be refused is refused with the
 * reason we claim. A case that cannot be expressed is a hole in the operation
 * set, and the time to find those is before the set is frozen.
