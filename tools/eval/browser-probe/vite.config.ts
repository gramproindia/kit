/*
 * Serves the probe only. Deliberately not part of playground: the probe
 * imports `@huggingface/transformers` and pulls half a gigabyte of weights,
 * and neither belongs anywhere near the showroom's dev server.
 *
 * It does import the real agent from `source/`, because the point of the
 * validator step is that the browser reaches the *production* validator rather
 * than a copy of it.
 *
 * No `defineConfig` import: this directory is outside the package that owns
 * node_modules, so `vite` is not resolvable from here even though the binary
 * is. A plain object is the same thing without the import.
