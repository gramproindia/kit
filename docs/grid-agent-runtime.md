# The DataGrid agent runtime

```
live DataGrid  →  runtime contract  →  validated command  →  executor  →  new GridState
```

No model appears anywhere in that line. Everything here works with a form, a
keyboard shortcut or a bookmark as the caller, and it ships four features that
have nothing to do with AI: **saved views, shareable URLs, an audit trail and
undo across every operation the grid has.** A model, when one is added, plugs
into the front — it produces the intent, and the five validation layers treat
it exactly as they treat any other untrusted input.

This is Phase 2 of the agent-native work. Phase 1 (`docs/component-passport.md`)
described what a component *is*. This describes what one instance of it *can
do, right now*, and how to make it do it safely.

## The four things, kept apart

They change for different reasons, so they are different objects:

| | Answers | Lives | Changes when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Passport** | what DataGrid knows how to do | `passport.json`, build time | the source changes |
| **Runtime contract** | what *this instance* can do | memory, per render | state or props change |
| **Intent** | what the caller is asking for | the wire | every request |
| **Executor** | how *this application* performs it | your code | you swap it |

The separation is not tidiness. Later, `Passport → A2UI`, `Passport + runtime
contract → a model's prompt and schema`, and `Intent → validator → executor`
all have to evolve independently; collapsed into one object they could not.

## Getting started

```tsx
import { DataGrid, createGridAgent, type GridApi } from "@/components/data-grid";

const options = { data, columns, getRowId: "id", enableRowSelection: true } as const;
const grid = useRef<GridApi<Customer>>(null);

const agent = useMemo(
  () =>
    createGridAgent({
      api: grid.current!,
      options,
      locale: "en-IN",
      semantics: {
        revenue: { unit: "INR", higherIsBetter: true, synonyms: ["arr", "sales"] },
        churnRisk: { percentBasis: "fraction", higherIsBetter: false },
        email: { pii: true },
      },
      policy: { confirmExportRows: 5000, maxSelectRows: 500 },
    }),
  [],
);

// Hand it this render's props when data, columns or feature flags change.
useEffect(() => agent.update(options));

<DataGrid {...options} ref={grid} />;
```

`options` is the same object you give `<DataGrid>` — data, columns and the
feature flags. The agent reads capabilities from it rather than being told them
twice.

Then:

```ts
const result = agent.validate({
  action: "filter", column: "revenue", operator: "gt", value: "1 lakh",
});

// { status: "done",
//   commands: [{ operation: "filter",
//                intent: { action: "filter", column: "revenue", operator: "gt", value: 100000 },
//                explain: { summary: "Filter Revenue greater than ₹1,00,000",
//                           interpretation: "revenue gt 100000",
//                           affectedRows: 1842, currentRows: 9310 } }],
//   warnings: [{ layer: "coercion", code: "scale-applied", message: 'Read "1 lakh" as 100000.' }] }

await agent.execute(result.commands[0].intent);
```

`validate` changes nothing, so it is also the confirmation preview: `explain`
carries everything a dialog needs.

## The runtime contract

`agent.contract()` returns, for this instance:

```jsonc
{
  "contract": "gbs.datagrid",
  "contractVersion": "1.0.0",
  "component": "DataGrid",
  "instanceId": "dg-1puyu5b",
  "capabilities": { "mode": "client", "sorting": true, "multiSort": true, "selection": true,
                    "selectionMode": "multiple", "columnPinning": true, "editing": false,
                    "exportFormats": ["csv", "excel", "pdf"], "undo": true /* … */ },
  "columns": [
    { "id": "revenue", "label": "Revenue", "type": "number",
      "visible": true, "pinned": null, "sortable": true, "filterable": true,
      "operators": ["equals", "notEquals", "gt", "gte", "lt", "lte", "between",
                    "isEmpty", "isNotEmpty"],
      "unit": "INR", "higherIsBetter": true,
      "stats": { "kind": "number", "min": 65000, "max": 45000000, "nulls": 0 } }
  ],
  "operations": ["search", "filter", "sort", /* … */ "undo", "redo"],
  "state": { "sorting": [], "filters": [], "search": "", "page": { "index": 0, "size": 50, "count": 1 },
             "selection": { "count": 0, "all": false }, "canUndo": false, "canRedo": false /* … */ },
  "stats": { "totalRows": 9310, "filteredRows": 1842, "pageRows": 50, "selectedRows": 0 }
}
```

Three rules it holds to:

**No rows, ever.** Counts and bounded summaries only. A contract is the thing
most likely to be handed to a model, and rows are the thing most likely to be
regretted.

**Nothing invented.** Every capability traces to a grid option or a resolved
column flag. There is no `grouping` because there is no grouping.

**Effective, not nominal.** Policy is applied here, so a column the host
restricted reports `filterable: false`, `operators: []` and `restricted:
"policy"`, and carries no summary.

### Column summaries, and the identifier rule

`stats` is on by default (`stats: false` turns it off). String columns get
their distinct values listed, because that is what stops a model inventing a
region that does not exist — but only when **some value repeats**. A column
with as many distinct values as there are rows is an identifier, not a
category, and listing it would be publishing the data. In a five-row table
every column looks low-cardinality; this rule is what keeps that from leaking.
`maxEnumValues` (default 20) caps the rest.

### Server mode

`totalRows` comes from `rowCount` and `filteredRows` is `null`: the client holds
one page, so any count would be a guess. Plausibility checks that need a count
are skipped rather than estimated.

## The generated intent schema

`agent.schema()` is a JSON Schema for one operation **on this instance**. Give
it to a constrained decoder and a model physically cannot emit an invalid
combination; give it to the validator and the same rule is enforced again,
because a schema that only lives in the decoder is one you are trusting someone
else to run.

The point is the filter branches — one per filterable column, each with that
column's own operator set:

```jsonc
{ "type": "object", "additionalProperties": false,
  "required": ["action", "column", "operator"],
  "properties": {
    "action":   { "const": "filter" },
    "column":   { "const": "revenue" },
    "operator": { "enum": ["equals", "notEquals", "gt", "gte", "lt", "lte",
                           "between", "isEmpty", "isNotEmpty"] },
    "value": { /* … */ } } }
```

`startsWith` on a number column is not rejected — it is unrepresentable.

What is strict and what is not:

| strict | permissive |
| --- | --- |
| action names, column ids, operator sets per column, export formats, densities, placements, page bounds | the *values* people write: `"1 lakh"`, `"20%"`, `"kerala"` |

Values stay loose on purpose. Narrowing them in the schema would reject the
input before the coercion layer saw it, and coercion is where `"1 lakh"` becomes
`100000` deterministically instead of a model guessing.

Generation is deterministic: the same contract always produces byte-identical
JSON.

**One caveat if you validate against a passport instead.** `checkSchema` turns
a schema's `pattern` into a `RegExp`, and a hostile pattern is a denial of
service. The intent schema above is generated from the live contract and never
carries one. A passport's `operations[].input` is authored text that may travel
with an installed component — so if you are tempted to write
`checkSchema(intent, passport.operations.filter.input)`, strip `pattern` first,
or use the generated schema, which is the one the validator uses anyway. See
the *Trust* section of `docs/component-passport.md`.

## The five layers

| Layer | Asks | Example refusal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 schema | is this a shape this instance accepts? | `enum` — `startsWith` is not an operator for Revenue |
| 2 reference | do the column, option and rows it names exist? | `unknown-column` — "there is no column `revenu`. Did you mean `revenue`?" |
| 3 coercion | what do its values mean? | `not-a-number` — Revenue is a number, and "lots" is not one |
| 4 policy | is it allowed? | `not-filterable` — Email is restricted by the application |
| 5 plausibility | does the result look like what was meant? | `empty-result` (warning), `export-too-large` (refusal) |

A failure stops there; later layers would only add noise about a dead command.
The layer a check belongs to is a property of the check, not of when it runs —
a couple of reference and policy checks run *before* the schema, because
"Email cannot be filtered" is a better message than "matched no branch", and
the schema would only have said the latter.

Result shape:

```ts
{ status: "done",                commands, warnings, state }
{ status: "needs-confirmation",  commands, warnings, confirm: { code, message } }
{ status: "rejected",            reason, code, layer, suggestion?, issues }
```

Nothing that failed validation ever runs.

### Coercion, in detail

Deterministic code, with a test for every form it claims to read:

| Written | Read as | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `1 lakh`, `2 crore`, `1.5 cr`, `500k`, `2 million` | 100000, 20000000, 15000000, 500000, 2000000 | `scale-applied` |
| `₹1,00,000`, `Rs 25,00,000` | 100000, 2500000 | Indian grouping needs no special case |
| `(2,400)` | −2400 | accountants' parentheses |
| `$2000` on an INR column | 2000, **unconverted** | `currency-mismatch` — no exchange rate is invented |
| `40%` on `percentBasis: "fraction"` | 0.4 | `percent-converted` |
| `50` on `percentBasis: "fraction"` | 0.5 | `percent-basis-assumed` — the guess is reported |
| `20%` on `percentBasis: "whole"` | 20 | stored as written |
| `last month` on a date column | `between 2026-09-01 .. 2026-09-30` | `relative-range` — the operator is widened, and that is said |
| `kerala` where the data says `Kerala` | `Kerala` | `case-normalised` |
| `GOLD` where the option is `{ label: "Gold", value: "gold" }` | `gold` | `option-normalised` |
| `around diwali` | **refused** | only documented phrases resolve |

Relative phrases understood: `today`, `yesterday`, `tomorrow`, `this/last
week|month|quarter|year`, and `last N days|weeks|months|years`. Weeks start on
Monday. Anything else fails loudly rather than landing on a plausible wrong
date. Pass `now` to make them testable.

### Plausibility runs the query without running it

`projectQuery` works out what the filters would be, and the dataset counts the
matches — so `explain.affectedRows` is the real number before anything changes.
That is what powers:

```
You asked      Show customers with revenue above 1 lakh.
Reading as     Revenue > ₹1,00,000
Affected rows  1,842 of 9,310
               [Apply]  [Cancel]
```

Warnings: `empty-result`, `no-op` (every row already shown matches),
`barely-narrows` (keeps ≥95%). Confirmations: anything irreversible
(`export`, `print`, `copy`) and any export above `confirmExportRows`.

## Executors

An operation is **not** welded to an imperative handle:

```ts
interface OperationExecutor<TInput, TContract, TResult> {
  readonly operation: string;
  /** Set only when `execute` really does call that method. Never required. */
  readonly apiMethod?: string;
  execute(input: TInput, context: ExecutionContext<TContract>): TResult | Promise<TResult>;
}
```

For DataGrid today, `filter` calls `GridApi.setFilter`. For a controlled
component such as DatePicker it would call the host's `onChange`. Same
operation, same schema, different executor — and the contract, the validator
and the history never learn which.

Three operations prove `apiMethod` is optional rather than merely nullable:

- **`export`** spans three methods (`exportCsv`, `exportExcel`, `exportPdf`), so
  no single one applies.
- **`undo`** and **`redo`** are the agent's snapshot history. The grid has no
  method for them at all.

Pass `executors` to `createGridAgent` to replace the registry wholesale.

## Operations

21, each backed by something the grid really implements. `agent.contract().operations`
narrows them to the instance: a grid with `enableRowSelection: false` offers no
`selectRows`.

| Operation | GridApi method |
| --- | --- |
| `search` | `setGlobalFilter` |
| `filter` | `setFilter` |
| `clearFilters` | `clearFilters` |
| `sort` / `clearSort` | `setSorting` |
| `selectRows` | `toggleRowSelected` |
| `selectAll` | `toggleAllRowsSelected` |
| `clearSelection` | `clearSelection` |
| `setColumnVisibility` | `setColumnVisibility` |
| `pinColumn` | `pinColumn` |
| `moveColumn` | `moveColumn` |
| `setColumnWidth` | `setColumnWidth` |
| `resetColumns` | `resetColumns` |
| `setPage` | `setPageIndex` |
| `setPageSize` | `setPageSize` |
| `setDensity` | `setDensity` |
| `export` | *(three methods)* |
| `print` | `print` |
| `copy` | `copyToClipboard` |
| `undo` / `redo` | *(the agent's history)* |

`agent/operations.ts` is the catalog; `passport.manual.json` publishes the same
set; `tools/eval/__tests__/corpus.test.ts` fails if the two drift.

### What is deliberately absent

- **grouping, aggregation, pivot, charts** — the grid implements none.
- **row mutation** (add, delete, set-cell) — there is no imperative write for a
  cell value. Editing is a UI affordance, driven by `onCellEdit`.
- **`notIn`** — a column with fixed `options` filters by membership only, so an
  exclusion has to list the complement.
- **multi-value filter on a plain string column** — one column holds one
  filter. Two filters on the same column in one batch are refused
  (`duplicate-column-filter`) rather than silently keeping the last.
- **limit / top-N** — "top 10" has no honest expression beyond sort + page size.

## History, views and URLs

Undo is by **snapshot**, not by inverse. Writing an inverse for every operation
means writing it again for every operation added later, and getting it wrong
once is a corrupted document. `GridState` is small and serialisable — which is
the precondition for a component being agent-operable at all — so storing it
whole is both cheaper to maintain and exactly correct.

```ts
agent.undo(); agent.redo(); agent.canUndo();
agent.history();   // [{ label: "Filter Revenue greater than ₹1,00,000", before, after, at }]

const view = agent.saveView("Kerala accounts");
location.hash = encodeGridView(view);          // URL-safe, no dependency

const restored = decodeGridView(location.hash.slice(1));
if (restored) agent.applyView(restored);        // itself undoable
```

A batch is one history entry: "Kerala customers over a crore, newest first" is
three operations and one undo. An operation that changes nothing records
nothing, so a no-op never costs an undo.

**Caveat.** Undo restores state through `GridApi.setState`, which can only write
the keys the grid owns. If the host controls `sorting` or `filters` through the
`state` prop, the host owns undoing them too.

## Policy

```ts
policy: {
  deny: ["internalNotes"],         // no operation may touch these
  denyFilter: ["email"],           // filterable, but not by a caller
  denyPii: true,                   // default: columns marked pii are denied
  denyOperations: ["export"],
  maxExportRows: 50000,
  confirmExportRows: 5000,         // default
  allowExportFormats: ["csv"],
  maxSelectRows: 1000,             // default
}
```

**One limit worth knowing.** The global search is not column-scoped: the grid
matches it against every column whose *definition* says `searchable`. Policy
cannot narrow that, because there is no per-search API to narrow. The validator
warns (`search-covers-restricted`) rather than implying an enforcement it does
not have. The real fix is `searchable: false` on the column definition.

## The utterance corpus

`eval/grid/v0/` holds 230 hand-written cases against one fixed grid
(`fixture.json` — 40 customers, 12 columns, authored semantics, a policy).

```bash
npm run eval:grid      # coverage report
pnpm -C playground exec vitest run ../tools/eval
```

Without a model there is no accuracy to measure, and that is fine — this does
not measure a model. It measures the **contract**: whether every reading a
person would reasonably expect can be expressed as a command this grid accepts,
and whether everything that should be refused is refused for the reason we
claim. A case that cannot be expressed is a hole in the operation set, and the
time to find those is before the set is frozen.

Each case is one JSON object:

```jsonc
{ "id": "grid-161", "category": "scale",
  "utterance": "Revenue above 1 lakh", "expect": "accept",
  "intents": [{ "action": "filter", "column": "revenue", "operator": "gt", "value": "1 lakh" }] }

{ "id": "grid-198", "category": "unsupported",
  "utterance": "Group the rows by region", "expect": "reject",
  "code": "unknown-operation",
  "intents": [{ "action": "group", "column": "region" }],
  "note": "The grid implements no grouping, so no operation declares it." }
```

181 accept, 39 reject, 10 ambiguous; 18 distinct rejection codes; all 21
operations covered. Ambiguous cases carry `alternatives`, and the test requires
every reading to validate — the point is not that one is right, it is that the
contract can express the disagreement. "Show the worst performing customers"
has three defensible readings across three columns that each declare a
direction of goodness; that is a question to ask, not a guess to make.

Nothing under `agent/` imports React, so a command can be validated on a server
before it is ever sent to a browser.

## Asking in words: `<DataGrid ai />`

A person types a sentence; the grid moves. The whole integration is a provider
and a prop:

```tsx
import { GramproAIProvider } from "@/components/shared";
import { DataGrid } from "@/components/data-grid";

<GramproAIProvider adapter={myAdapter} suggestions={["Who earns over 150k?"]}>
  <DataGrid data={rows} columns={cols} ai semantics={SEMANTICS} agentPolicy={POLICY} />
</GramproAIProvider>
```

`adapter` is one function. No model is bundled, downloaded or named:

```ts
type AgentAdapter = (request: {
  utterance: string;        // what the person typed
  contract: unknown;        // what this grid can do, right now
  responseSchema: JsonSchema;
  signal?: AbortSignal;
}) => Promise<unknown>;      // the response envelope, unvalidated
```

Whatever it returns goes straight to `agent.respond()`. A model that invents a
column, picks an operator the type does not have, or answers with prose gets
refused by the same five layers a form faces, and the person sees the
validator's words rather than a guess. **The adapter proposes; it never acts.**

### Without a provider there is no feature

`ai` with no `<GramproAIProvider>` above it renders the grid exactly as before —
no box, no network, no bytes. That is the opt-in: an application that never
configures an adapter cannot accidentally ship one. `createGridAgent` is also
only called when `ai` is on, so a grid nobody will ask questions of does not pay
to derive column statistics.

### What the box does with each answer

| The validator says | The person sees |
| --- | --- |
| `done` | what was applied, in the grid's own words, plus any coercion note — `scale-applied: Read "150k" as 150000` |
| `clarify` | the model's question, with the grid untouched |
| `needs-confirmation` | the confirmation, and a **Yes, do it** button — irreversible work never runs on a sentence alone |
| `rejected` | the reason, the layer that refused it, and any suggested column |
| `declined` | why this grid cannot do that |

A failure to *reach* the adapter is reported separately from the adapter
refusing, so a network error never reads as "your wording was wrong".

### What leaves the page, and how to stop it

The adapter receives the **runtime contract**, and the contract contains real
values from the grid. A category column with few distinct values has them
listed — that is deliberate, and it is what lets a model map the word "Kerala"
onto the `region` column instead of guessing. But it means that enabling `ai`
with a remote adapter sends a sample of the host's data to whoever that adapter
calls. Say so in your own privacy documentation.

Three controls, in order of precision:

| Control | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `semantics: { email: { pii: true } }` | **The column is denied entirely** and *carries no summary* — a summary is the data in miniature, so a PII column contributes no values. On by default via `policy.denyPii`. |
| `policy.deny: ["email"]` | The same, for columns that are not personal data but should not be described. |
| `stats: false` on `createGridAgent` | No column is summarised at all. The contract still describes types and operators, so the model keeps working; it loses the value hints that help it resolve words to columns. |

The safe default is to mark personal columns `pii` and leave the rest. A column
that is already restricted by `policy.denyFilter` **is still summarised** —
`denyFilter` governs what may be done with a column, not whether it may be
described. Use `deny` or `pii` when the values themselves are the concern.

A local adapter — one that never leaves the browser — makes all of this moot,
which is the main argument for the browser-local direction.

### Keys belong on a server

The demo's adapter posts to the application's own endpoint, which holds the key
and builds the prompt. Putting a model key in client JavaScript publishes it to
every visitor, so the library has no key handling and no provider of its own —
swapping one model for another is a change to the host's adapter alone.

## WebMCP: letting a browser agent drive the grid

WebMCP lets a page hand its own tools to whatever agent is driving the browser.
One call registers the grid:

```tsx
import { createGridAgent, registerGridTool } from "@/components/data-grid";

const agent = createGridAgent({ api: apiRef.current, options, semantics, policy });
const result = registerGridTool(agent);

if (!result.registered) console.info(result.reason);
```

That is the whole integration. It registers **one** tool, `operate_grid`, whose
input schema *is* `agent.schema()` — so a grid with different columns, operator
sets or policy advertises different arguments with no extra work.

One tool, not twenty-one, because the operation list is not the agent's
interface: the generated intent schema is, since that is where the contract and
the five layers already meet. Twenty-one separately exposed operations would be
twenty-one schemas to keep in step with a contract that already describes
itself.

### It adds no second path

`execute` runs the production pipeline and nothing else — validate, stop on
anything irreversible, then execute. There is no repair, no retry and no
WebMCP-only branch. An agent that sends something the grid cannot do gets the
same refusal, with the same `code` and `layer`, that a form would have got, and
nothing mutates:

| An agent sends | Layer | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a column that does not exist | reference | `unknown-column`, with the nearest real column suggested |
| an operator the column's type lacks | schema | `enum` — and a policy-denied column has no branch to target in the first place |
| a filter on a `denyFilter` column | policy | `not-filterable` |
| `export` with no confirmation | — | `needs-confirmation`; the download does not happen |
| `{ "intents": [] }` | — | `missing-intents`, before the validator is reached |

An agent does not get to skip a confirmation a person would see.

### Browser support, honestly

The specification is a [Draft Community Group
Report](https://webmachinelearning.github.io/webmcp/) and is not on the W3C
standards track. It is implemented in Chromium only, behind
`--enable-features=WebMCPTesting`, the `chrome://flags/#enable-webmcp-testing`
flag, or an origin-trial token. Three details cost a wrong run each:

- it is `document.modelContext`; `navigator.modelContext` was the early
  spelling and has been deprecated since Chromium 150,
- Chrome passes `inputSchema` and the call arguments to the agent as JSON
  *strings*, and returns the result as a JSON string,
- `registerTool` throws on a duplicate name, and React StrictMode runs effects
  twice in development — so register once, behind a ref.

`registerGridTool` returns rather than throws when the surface is absent,
because that is the normal case today: the grid renders either way and the
agent affordance is simply not there. `webmcpAvailable()` answers the same
question without registering, and both guard `document` rather than assuming
it, so importing this during server rendering is safe.

### Any component, not just the grid

The mechanism is component-agnostic and lives in
`shared/core/agent/webmcp.ts`. `registerAgentTool` takes anything satisfying
`ProjectableAgent` — `schema()`, `validate()`, `execute()` — plus `describe`
and `summarise` for the parts that are specific to a component.
`registerGridTool` is a thirty-line binding over it, and a DatePicker binding
would be the same size once that component has operations.

Because the projection owns no semantics, a `modelContext` can be injected: a
host that wants a tool registered somewhere other than `document` — a test, a
polyfill, an in-page registry so a UI can exercise the same descriptor on a
browser without WebMCP — passes one in.

### Where it fits against a model

WebMCP and a natural-language model answer different questions and do not
compete. WebMCP serves an agent that is **already** driving the browser, and
requires the library to ship no model at all. A model would serve a *user*
typing into the application's own UI. Both converge on the same validator and
the same executors, which is what makes having both sane rather than
duplicative — and it is why neither needs to be a core dependency.

## Answering as something other than a command

A producer of intents — a model, a form, a macro — answers with one of three
things, and all three are schema-checked:

```jsonc
{ "result": "command",  "intents": [ … ] }
{ "result": "clarify",  "question": "Which measure of performance did you mean?" }
{ "result": "declined", "reason": "This grid cannot group." }
```

`agent.respond(response)` validates the envelope; `agent.responseSchema()` is
what a constrained decoder should be given. Clarifying is not a way around the
validator — a `clarify` with no question comes back rejected, because a label
is not a question — and neither a clarification nor a refusal executes
anything.

This exists because a producer that can only emit a command has to guess when a
request is ambiguous, and a confident wrong filter is the failure the whole
pipeline is built to prevent. Asking is a correct answer.

## What is next

`docs/grid-agent-evaluation.md` — the benchmark harness over this runtime: one
versioned prompt, four model tiers, scoring on the post-coercion command rather
than the model's JSON, and a self-test that must hit 100% before any model
number counts.

`docs/controlled-component-adapter.md` — DatePicker and Combobox have no
imperative write API, and inventing one just to fit this architecture would be
the wrong fix. That design has to be settled before either gets operations.
